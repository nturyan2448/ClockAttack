The game that I sumbitted was just a mechanic, where playing a card would change the time. I can tell that with that single mechanic the game does not contain anything that looks interesting. One of the playtesters understand what I planned to do to extend the game to a multi-player one. All others didn't show interest in my game including the instructors and just said that the game needed to be more juicy. With that simple mechanic, there weren't many meaningful advices in the playtest.
Eventually I made a game as I planned, a multi-player card game, and tried to make it as juicy as possible. The lesson learned from this experience that even for the first milestone submitted, the game should have something that can catch people's eye and convince that the full game will be engaging.
